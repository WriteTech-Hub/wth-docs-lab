# Welcome to WTH Docs Lab! ðŸš€

This repository is designed to help **technical writers** improve documentation skills, compare different styles of documentation, and onboard into WriteTech Hub.

## Introduction

The **WTH Docs Lab** repository is created to serve two key purposes:

1. **Portfolio Showcase** â€“ Demonstrating before-and-after improvements in documentation through structured comparisons, with annotated screenshots highlighting issues and refinements.
2. **Technical Writing Learning Lab** â€“ Providing onboarding resources, best practices, and structured learning paths for technical writers to improve their documentation skills.

This repository is still in its early stages, and we are in the process of structuring it according to our planned information architecture. We will be integrating our portfolio samples, refining the layout, and ensuring it becomes a useful resource for both internal team members and external contributors.

## ðŸ”¹ How to Use This Repository
1. **Explore the Onboarding Roadmap** â†’ Follow structured learning paths.
2. **Compare Documentation** â†’ Learn from before-and-after examples.
3. **Contribute & Improve** â†’ Join discussions, review docs, and contribute.

## Technology Stack

This project is built using **Hugo** with the **Doks** theme, a powerful static site generator designed for documentation.

### ðŸ“Œ **Resources**

- **Hugo Documentation:** [https://gohugo.io/documentation/](https://gohugo.io/documentation/)
- **Doks Theme Documentation:** [https://getdoks.org/docs/start-here/getting-started/](https://getdoks.org/docs/start-here/getting-started/)
- **Doks Project Structure:** [https://getdoks.org/docs/basics/project-structure/](https://getdoks.org/docs/basics/project-structure/)
- **Doks GitHub Repository:** [https://github.com/h-enk/doks](https://github.com/h-enk/doks)

## Planned Repository Structure

We are in the process of adapting the Doks theme to fit our needs. Once completed, the structure should be similar to the following:

```
ðŸ“¦ wth-docs
 â”£ ðŸ“‚ content
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚ guide  # Onboarding and learning materials
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œ _index.md  # Overview of onboarding
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œ getting-started.md  # Technical writing intro
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œ roadmap.md  # Learning roadmap
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œ resources.md  # External references
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚ docs  # Before-and-after documentation comparisons
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œ _index.md  # Overview of refinement process
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚ api-docs  # API documentation transformations
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚ user-guides  # User documentation transformations
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚ compliance-docs  # Compliance document comparisons
 â”£ ...
 â”£ ðŸ“œ README.md  # Repository overview
 â”£ ðŸ“œ CONTRIBUTING.md  # Contribution guidelines
 â”£ ðŸ“œ CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md  # Community standards

This structure will evolve as we set up the repository and refine the organization of content.
